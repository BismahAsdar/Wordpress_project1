# Selenium Test Suite README

This README provides instructions on how to set up and run a Selenium test suite written in JavaScript using the Eclipse IDE environment.

## Requirements

Before running the test suite, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

1. **Eclipse IDE**: Download and install Eclipse IDE from [https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).

2. **Node.js and npm**: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can download and install them from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
Ensure you have a JavaScript development environment set up on your system. You can use Node.js, which includes npm (Node Package Manager), to manage packages and dependencies. If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download and install it from the official website: https://nodejs.org/.

3. **Selenium WebDriver**: Install Selenium WebDriver for JavaScript using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install selenium-webdriver
   
Install Selenium WebDriver:
You can use npm to install Selenium WebDriver for JavaScript (Selenium WebDriverJS). Run the following command to install the selenium-webdriver package:
npm install selenium-webdriver
This command will download and install the Selenium WebDriver package along with its dependencies.

Download WebDriver Executables:
Selenium WebDriver requires browser-specific WebDriver executables to interface with browsers. You'll need to download the WebDriver executable(s) for the browser(s) you intend to automate and place them in a directory that is included in your system's PATH.

Chrome WebDriver: Download ChromeDriver from https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/.

Firefox WebDriver (GeckoDriver): Download GeckoDriver from https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases.

Edge WebDriver: Download Microsoft Edge WebDriver from https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/.


Create a Project Directory:
Create a directory where you want to work on your Selenium WebDriver project. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory, and create a new Node.js project by running the following command:
This will create a package.json file for your project.


Ensure that the directory containing these WebDriver executables is added to your system's PATH so that Selenium can find them.

Create a JavaScript Test Script:
Create a JavaScript file (e.g., test.js) where you will write your Selenium WebDriver test scripts.

# Write and Run Selenium WebDriver Test Scripts:
In your test.js file, you can use the selenium-webdriver package to write your test scripts. Here's a basic example of opening a Chrome browser and navigating to a website:

## Set Up Eclipse Environment
Open Eclipse: Launch Eclipse IDE.

### Create a New JavaScript Project:

Click File > New > Project.
Select JavaScript > JavaScript Project.
Enter a project name and click Finish.
Add Selenium WebDriver for JavaScript:

In Eclipse, right-click on your project in the Project Explorer.
Select Properties.
In the properties window, navigate to JavaScript > Include Path.
Under the Libraries tab, click Add External JARs....
Browse and select the Selenium WebDriver for JavaScript (selenium-webdriver package) installed via npm.
Click Apply and Close.

#### Write Your Selenium Test Suite
Create JavaScript Test Files:

In Eclipse, right-click on your project or a specific folder within the project.
Select New > File.
Name the file with a .js extension (e.g., myTestSuite.js) and click Finish.
Write Your Test Suite:

Open the JavaScript test file in the Eclipse editor.
Write your Selenium test suite using the selenium-webdriver library.

Customize and Expand Your Test Suite
You can customize and expand your test suite by adding more test files, test cases, and assertions as needed. Ensure that you organize your test suite for maintainability and reusability.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues while running the test suite, refer to the error messages in the Eclipse console for guidance. Verify that the WebDriver executables are correctly configured in your system's PATH.
